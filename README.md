# TextEngine
DEVELOPMENT ON HOLD

My plan is to create an engine for old-school text-based adventure games.

The files `json.hpp` and `openai.hpp` are sourced from https://github.com/olrea/openai-cpp/tree/main because I would like to use AI to compare the key messages to the input provided by the user. Currently, the focus is on the game aspect, and later, I intend to incorporate Qt or another framework to enable developers to create their own games using this engine.

The scope of the project is quite extensive, and I am unsure how far I will progress. However, I work on it during my free time as a hobby project.
